# Project 0
Four web pages created with HTML and CSS.

### Introduction
Project 0 for Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course from Harvard. 
I decided to make their content about three different mythologies since I find them quite interesting.
It contains four html pages - index which is a main page, aztec for Aztec mythology, mesopotamian for Mesopotamian Mythology and slavic for Slavic Mythology.
Moreover it also contains two stylesheets - styles which was written in CSS and sass_file which was written in Sass and translated to CSS.
I used Bootstrap's grid and button which you can find here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/grid/ and here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/buttons/
